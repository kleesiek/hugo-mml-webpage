abstract: 'Background  Many studies emphasize the role of structured reports (SRs)
  because they are readily accessible for further automated analyses. However, using
  SR data obtained in clinical routine for research purposes is not yet well represented
  in literature.  Purpose  To compare the performance of the Qanadli scoring system
  with a clot burden score mined from structured pulmonary embolism (PE) reports from
  CT angiography.  Materials and Methods  In this retrospective study, a rule-based
  text mining pipeline was developed to extract descriptors of PE and right heart
  strain from SR of patients with suspected PE between March 2017 and February 2020.
  From standardized PE reporting, a pulmonary artery obstruction index (PAOI) clot
  burden score (PAOICBS) was derived and compared with the Qanadli score (PAOIQ).
  Scoring time and confidence from two independent readings were compared. Interobserver
  and interscore agreement was tested by using the intraclass correlation coefficient
  (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. To assess conformity and diagnostic performance
  of both scores, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were
  calculated to predict right heart strain incidence, as were optimal cutoff values
  for maximum sensitivity and specificity.  Results  SR content authored by 67 residents
  and signed off by 32 consultants from 1248 patients (mean age, 63 years ± 17 [standard
  deviation]; 639 men) was extracted accurately and allowed for PAOICBS calculation
  in 304 of 357 (85.2%) PE-positive reports. The PAOICBS strongly correlated with
  the PAOIQ (r = 0.94; P textless .001). Use of PAOICBS yielded overall time savings
  (1.3 minutes ± 0.5 vs 3.0 minutes ± 1.7), higher confidence levels (4.2 ± 0.6 vs
  3.6 ± 1.0), and a higher ICC (ICC, 0.99 vs 0.95), respectively, compared with PAOIQ
  (each, P textless .001). AUCs were similar for PAOICBS (AUC, 0.75; 95% CI: 0.70,
  0.81) and PAOIQ (AUC, 0.77; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.83; P = .68), with cutoff values of
  27.5% for both scores.  Conclusion  Data mining of structured reports enabled the
  development of a CT angiography scoring system that simplified the Qanadli score
  as a semiquantitative estimate of thrombus burden in patients with pulmonary embolism.  ©
