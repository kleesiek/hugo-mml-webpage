abstract: The aortic vessel tree is composed of the aorta and its branching arteries,
  and plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases, like
  aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment with open
  surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug treatment under
  constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the vessels through imaging.
  The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and monitoring is computed tomography
  (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of the aorta and its branching vessels
  if combined with a contrast agent, resulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally,
  the whole aortic vessel tree geometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared.
  This allows to not only detect changes in the aorta, but also more peripheral vessel
  tree changes, caused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed
  manually, this reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily
  take a whole day for a single aortic vessel tree and, hence, is not feasible in
  clinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation algorithms,
  on the other hand, can complete this task in a fraction of the manual execution
  time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the clinicians. In this paper,
  we systematically review computing techniques for the automatic and semi-automatic
  segmentation of the aortic vessel tree. The review concludes with an in-depth discussion
  on how close these state-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical
  practice and how active this research field is, taking into account the number of
  publications, datasets and challenges.
