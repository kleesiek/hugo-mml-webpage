	abstract = {Modern generative deep learning (DL) architectures allow for unsupervised learning of latent representations that can be exploited in several downstream tasks. Within the ﬁeld of oncological medical imaging, we term these latent representations “digital tumor signatures” and hypothesize that they can be used, in analogy to radiomics features, to differentiate between lesions and normal liver tissue. Moreover, we conjecture that they can be used for the generation of synthetic data, speciﬁcally for the artiﬁcial insertion and removal of liver tumor lesions at user-deﬁned spatial locations in CT images. Our approach utilizes an implicit autoencoder, an unsupervised model architecture that combines an autoencoder and two generative adversarial network (GAN)-like components. The model was trained on liver patches from 25 or 57 inhouse abdominal CT scans, depending on the experiment, demonstrating that only minimal data is required for synthetic image generation. The model was evaluated on a publicly available data set of 131 scans. We show that a PCA embedding of the latent representation captures the structure of the data, providing the foundation for the targeted insertion and removal of tumor lesions. To assess the quality of the synthetic images, we conducted two experiments with ﬁve radiologists. For experiment 1, only one rater and the ensemble-rater were marginally above the chance level in distinguishing real from synthetic data. For the second experiment, no rater was above the chance level. To illustrate that the “digital signatures” can also be used to differentiate lesion from normal tissue, we employed several machine learning methods. The best performing method, a LinearSVM, obtained 95\% (97\%) accuracy, 94\% (95\%) sensitivity, and 97\% (99\%) speciﬁcity, depending on if all data or only normal appearing patches were used for training of the implicit autoencoder. Overall, we demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised learning paradigm can be utilized for the removal and insertion of liver lesions at user deﬁned spatial locations and that the digital signatures can be used to discriminate between lesions and normal liver tissue in abdominal CT scans.},

	abstract = {Background

Many studies emphasize the role of structured reports (SRs) because they are readily accessible for further automated analyses. However, using SR data obtained in clinical routine for research purposes is not yet well represented in literature.

Purpose

To compare the performance of the Qanadli scoring system with a clot burden score mined from structured pulmonary embolism (PE) reports from CT angiography.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective study, a rule-based text mining pipeline was developed to extract descriptors of PE and right heart strain from SR of patients with suspected PE between March 2017 and February 2020. From standardized PE reporting, a pulmonary artery obstruction index (PAOI) clot burden score (PAOICBS) was derived and compared with the Qanadli score (PAOIQ). Scoring time and confidence from two independent readings were compared. Interobserver and interscore agreement was tested by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. To assess conformity and diagnostic performance of both scores, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were calculated to predict right heart strain incidence, as were optimal cutoff values for maximum sensitivity and specificity.

Results

SR content authored by 67 residents and signed off by 32 consultants from 1248 patients (mean age, 63 years ± 17 [standard deviation]; 639 men) was extracted accurately and allowed for PAOICBS calculation in 304 of 357 (85.2\%) PE-positive reports. The PAOICBS strongly correlated with the PAOIQ (r = 0.94; P {\textless} .001). Use of PAOICBS yielded overall time savings (1.3 minutes ± 0.5 vs 3.0 minutes ± 1.7), higher confidence levels (4.2 ± 0.6 vs 3.6 ± 1.0), and a higher ICC (ICC, 0.99 vs 0.95), respectively, compared with PAOIQ (each, P {\textless} .001). AUCs were similar for PAOICBS (AUC, 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.81) and PAOIQ (AUC, 0.77; 95\% CI: 0.72, 0.83; P = .68), with cutoff values of 27.5\% for both scores.

Conclusion

Data mining of structured reports enabled the development of a CT angiography scoring system that simplified the Qanadli score as a semiquantitative estimate of thrombus burden in patients with pulmonary embolism.

	abstract = {The aortic vessel tree is composed of the aorta and its branching arteries, and plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases, like aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment with open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug treatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the vessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and monitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of the aorta and its branching vessels if combined with a contrast agent, resulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree geometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared. This allows to not only detect changes in the aorta, but also more peripheral vessel tree changes, caused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed manually, this reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily take a whole day for a single aortic vessel tree and, hence, is not feasible in clinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation algorithms, on the other hand, can complete this task in a fraction of the manual execution time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the clinicians. In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for the automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree. The review concludes with an in-depth discussion on how close these state-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical practice and how active this research field is, taking into account the number of publications, datasets and challenges.},
